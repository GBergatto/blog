## Who am I?

My real name is Guglielmo, but you can call me Berga. I'm 20 years old, live in Italy, and study computer science at Politecnico di Torino.

## What is this blog about?
I'm exploring the vast field of computer science to figure out what interests me the most. I'll share what I learn along the journey in this blog. 

Topics I will cover include:
- Programming
- Cybersecurity and hacking
- Competitive programming and CTFs
- Linux: customization and workflows
- Obsidian: how I use it to study and take notes

I will post every article I write on [Medium](gberga.medium.com), too. So you can follow me there if you prefer.


## When will I be posting?
Every time I have something worth sharing, which hopefully should happen every week.

## Why did I start this blog?
- To network and connect with new people
- To show my skills and personality and share my interests
